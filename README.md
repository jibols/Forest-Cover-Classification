# Forest-Cover-Classification

Submission to the [Learn Together](https://www.kaggle.com/c/learn-together) Kaggle Competition, Kaggle's first, invite-only, beginner-friendly competition.

The competition datasets comes from a study conducted in four wilderness areas within the beautiful Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with very little human disturbances â€“ the existing forest cover types there are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.
